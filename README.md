Welcome to slcmAPI - the Open-Sourced REST-API for Manipal University's Student Life cycle Management Portal. This API is an aid for those who want to build an app or a website requiring data on SLcM. Avoid the hassle of writing your code to scrape data from the website when all you can do is make queries to this API.
